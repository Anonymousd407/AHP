# AHP Staff UI Demo Milestone

Feature branch: `feat/ahp-staff-ui-demo-20260913`

Protected checkpoint:

- Branch: `checkpoint/ahp-unified-staff-20260913`
- Commit: `3c5a1f5499b12cf70e99be274bfcb9f037c423b1`

Main app URL: `http://localhost:3000`

Normal local start command:

```bash
bash dev-web.sh web
```

## Demo Data

Namespace: `AHP_STAFF_DEMO_V1`

Pre-seed private database backup:

`/home/kali/ahp-local-backups/ahp-staff-ui-demo-preseed-20260913-150843/`

Seed command:

```bash
AHP_STAFF_DEMO_CONFIRM=write-local-ahealth_dev pnpm seed:staff-demo
```

The seed refuses production, non-`ahealth_dev`, non-local database targets, non-console SMS, and non-console mobile-money configuration. It writes deterministic records and leaves existing accounts, passwords, cases and assignments unchanged.

Manifest:

`test-results/ahp-staff-demo/manifest.json`

Demo login notes:

- Main clinician: `daktari@dev.local`
- Platform admin: `msimamizi@dev.local`
- Demo specialist clinician: `ahp.staff.demo.specialist@dev.local`
- Demo unrelated clinician: `ahp.staff.demo.unrelated@dev.local`
- Demo clinician password: same local dev clinician password, `Daktari#2026`

## Demo Coverage

The dataset adds fictional local records for:

- Offered and assigned clinician consultations.
- Two-sided care-thread messages.
- Appointment and slot.
- Diagnostic order and result value.
- Prescription-test-template and adherence records.
- Family assignment and professional network records.
- Second-opinion request.
- Facility, device, emergency request, incident, transport unit and local/mock payment.
- Aggregate research dataset/query and surveillance rollups.

## Undo

Do not run this automatically after verification; the browser stack should keep showing the demo records.

Narrow undo command:

```bash
AHP_STAFF_DEMO_CONFIRM=write-local-ahealth_dev pnpm undo:staff-demo
```

The undo deletes only deterministic IDs in namespace `AHP_STAFF_DEMO_V1`. It does not reset databases, truncate tables, delete volumes, or alter legacy apps.

## Current Implementation Notes

- Shared `apps/web` UI primitives now provide wider staff pages, refined cards, badges and a soft A-health product surface.
- Doctor queue has a navy-to-teal clinical header with a restrained line/dot pattern behind header content only.
- Unified links were corrected where old single-app routes missed `/doctor` or `/admin` prefixes.
- Follow-up adherence visibility now includes clinicians attached to the relevant care thread through primary or assigned consultation ownership.

## Verification Evidence

Completed on 2026-09-13 against `http://localhost:3000`.

- `pnpm --filter a-health-web type-check`: passed.
- `pnpm --filter a-health-web build`: passed while Next dev on port 3000 was stopped.
- `set -a; . services/followup/.env; set +a; pnpm --filter @a-health/followup test`: passed outside the sandbox with local Postgres access, 18 tests passed.
- Firefox Playwright after clean dev restart: passed real clinician login, platform admin login, demo specialist login, unrelated clinician authorization denial, Doctor/Admin/Analytics navigation, clinician denial from Admin/Analytics, persisted messaging/read-back/reply, dashboard API count matching, tab switching, direct refresh, logout, CSS response and mobile overflow checks.
- CSS evidence: `/_next/static/css/app/layout.css` returned `200 text/css`; login shell background `rgb(7, 26, 47)`, primary button `rgb(15, 76, 67)`, button padding `10px 20px`, input border `1px solid rgb(210, 217, 209)`, input radius `6px`.
- Dashboard count evidence from authorised API in browser: open emergencies `6`, pending verifications `1`, active devices `2`, open incidents `2`.

## Remaining Gaps

- The normal `bash dev-web.sh web` launcher can refuse to start in this executor when another service process already owns a required port. In that case, preserve the existing services and start only the unified app with `pnpm --filter a-health-web dev`.
- Some secondary pages still carry older explanatory copy and can be polished further, but the verified Doctor queue/case/messaging, Admin dashboard/emergency, and Analytics dashboard screens now render as one A-health staff product.
